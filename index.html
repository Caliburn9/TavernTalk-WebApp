    <h3>1711 Introduction to Server Environments and Architectures - Assignment 1</h3>

    <h3>Project Proposal: TavernTalk - An Anonymous Browser-based Chat Room</h3>
    <p>
        My project proposition for this assignment is a browser-based chat room themed around a medieval fantasy tavern. Users are assigned 2-dimensional avatars to control and move around in this tavern. The unique aspect of this project is that each user is anonymous and does not have to create accounts; they can begin conversing with other users immediately, emphasizing “transience, anonymity, and impermanence.” Just like travelers who stop at a tavern and meet new people before moving on, users can engage in transient conversations with users who wish to chat with others without creating permanent communities or relationships. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The main UI elements will be the chat box, which will be limited to text messages or emojis, and a speech bubble containing the user’s message that appears above their avatar, visible to everyone. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The project will use HTML and CSS for the frontend, JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.IO for real-time communication and movement handling, and will be deployed to an Amazon EC2 cloud server.
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure a manageable and achievable scope, the art will be drawn by myself in the pixel art style, with a single large tavern interior artwork for the main chat room area and about four or five randomly assigned avatars. A free-to-use font will be used for the UI. User messages will not be stored permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the nature of the project, attempts to tackle cybersecurity considerations such as chat filtering, content moderation, detecting hate speech, malicious hacking, and mitigating denial of service (DoS) will also be conducted during development and after deployment to maintain a safe and enjoyable user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the project offers potential for future scalability and feature expansion, making it a dynamic and evolving platform for anonymous real-time communication.
